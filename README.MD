## How to use
### How to use (Android)

Usage on Android is fairly simple:
- Download the latest release APK from [here](https://github.com/yuroyami/syncplay-mobile/releases/latest).
- Install the APK. If any installation issues arise, uninstall the previous version of the app before installing the new one.
- Open Syncplay. Specify a username of your choice, a room name of your choice (Tell your friends about it)
- Select a server from the list (Tell your friends about this one too)
- Click "Join Room". You will be taken to the Room screen. You're all set. Tell your friends to join the same room and server.
- Ta-Dah ! Just load the same video file as your friends and enjoy the synchronized playback.

### How to use (iOS)

The iOS version cannot be distributed in package format (like Android's APKs). The only ways to install
an app on iOS are to either compile this project by yourself on your macOS, or someone would kindly
donate to host this app on the Apple app store (the fee is a yearly $99).

Please note that the iOS version is not fully cooked yet, I will modify this readme once the development
is actually done. I'd say it's 95%, nearly done.

## Roadmap
These are the things I am willing to add/adjust in the future :

- [x] Adopt original Syncplay's Chat functionality
- [x] Shared Playlists
- [x] Support for custom/private servers
- [x] URL Support (as of 0.10.0)
- [x] Multiple player engines (Exoplayer, mpv)
- [x] Picture-in-picture mode (Floating window)
- [x] TLS/SSL Secure Connection Support
- [x] Multi-language Support (WIP)
    - [x] English
    - [x] Arabic
    - [x] French
    - [x] Chinese (by [Zhaodaidai](https://github.com/Zhaodaidai))
    - [x] Spanish (by [DoncanC](https://github.com/DoncanC))

## Components and architecture

* <b>UI:</b> Compose multiplatform
* <b>Architecture:</b> modular (mostly MVVM)
* <b>Network backbone:</b> Netty (Android) and Ktor (iOS)
* <b>Preferences:</b> Jetpack Datastore
* <b>Integrated media players:</b> Exoplayer or mpv (Android) - AVPlayer (iOS)

## F.A.Q

* If my friend uses Syncplay on PC, can I watch with them ?
  <br>-> Yes, you can. Syncplay Android is made to be interoperable.
* On Android, I get an error saying "App not installed" upon installing the app. What's wrong ?
  <br>-> Uninstall the older version before installing the new one.
* Can I use the ipa package to install the iOS to my device ?
  <br>-> If that is possible, why not ? I will publish the ipa package nonetheless once it's ready.

## Translating

* If you want to contribute with a translation in a language that isn't available in Syncplay, or
  enhance the actual translations, please refer to [#30](https://github.com/yuroyami/syncplay-mobile/issues/30)

## Feedback

Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/yuroyami/syncplay-mobile/issues/new).

If there's anything you'd like to chat about, please feel free to open a new discussion.

## Build Process

The project is developed under Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.3.1
Make sure you have a version equal or later than the one I am using (Or you will need to downgrade Gradle plugins). Download the source code ZIP and
extract it somewhere, then open it using Android Studio. Then you can just build the app using a
custom JKS keystore of your choice (Edit the keystore information on the
module's ```build.gradle.kts```).
